# umbraco-fun

learning umbraco...

tutorials are all a bit basic - but I am a beginner so lets see how this goes.

## snippets - mostly regarding data access, pulled from Umraco.TV

```
var rootNodes = Umbraco.TypedContentAtRoot();
var homeNodeById = rootNodes.First(x => x.Id == 1077); //by node id
var rootNodes.FirstOrDefault(x => x.DocumentTypeAlias == "myHomePage"); //by dt alias

```

`var contentModel = Model.Content.As<GameGatewayModel>(); //cast model content to our model`

`var spotModel = Model.Content.GetPropertyValue<SpotModel>("spotGame"); // "raw" umbraco IPublishedContent Id, Parent, Children etc`

where .Properties is a coll of `IPublishedProperty`

In Um there is insert dialogue that can be used to write a lot of template code for you. Check this out for syntax basics.

```
Umbraco.TypedContentAtRoot(); //will return a collection of all nodes in the root of your content tree, irrespective of path and tree structure

var siteSettings= Umbraco.TypedContentAtRoot().FirstOrDefault(x => x.ContentType.Alias.Equals("SiteSettings")); 
```

#### tv: Querying Umbraco data with Razor




`@Umbraco.Field("promoTitle")`
This seems to be the standard way to get data entered into a DocumentType (page) using the @Umbraco helper. 
To clarify, we are on Blob Post "About Bob" and getting the information we entered into that particular post - not data elsewhere.

```var selection = Model.Content.Site().Children().Where(x => x.IsVisible())
@Item.Url, @Item.Name
// Although this looks like we are traversing the properties of a model I guess we must also be creating a query here
// in this case from the site root get all visible children. Presumably this doesn't actually fetch the entire db, just one level?

//from the site root, get blogpage's blogitems
var selection = Model.Content.Site().FirstChild("blogPage").Children("blogItem").Where(x => x.IsVisible())
```

There is an Umbraco "convention" where umbracoNaviHide and Visible can be used to hide by conventions.

Needs a property with the alias umbracoNaviHide on the DocumentType > Generic Properties, as TrueFalse Type this allows the
.Where("Visible") bit. This is different from `x => x.IsVisible` which is full hiding, not just from nav


```
// debug helper
@if (Model != null && Model.Properties.Any())
{
    <ul>
        @foreach (var property in Model.Properties.OrderBy(x => x.PropertyTypeAlias))
        {
            <li>@($"{property.PropertyTypeAlias}: {property.Value}")</li>
        }
    </ul>
}
```

`string imageUrl = Model.Content.GetPropertyValue<IPublishedContent>("headerImage").Url; //img url `

`CurrentPage.Children  //Listing SubPages rfom Current Page`

```//Listing SubPages by Level (eg: always show level 2 items as nav (home = 1)
.AncestorOrSelf(level) // returns DynamicPublishedContect can then get .Children()
```

`.isAncestorOrSelf(CurrentPage) ? "myActiveCssClass" : null //set active nav item snippet`


#### Macros (templates, RTE, Grid) and Partial (templates) Views

note: partial view macro file is the display(?) of the macro, not the macro itself.

macros can be configured with parameters and easy to enable caching.
 
`@Umbraco.RenderMacro("alias"); //macro no params `

`Model.GetParameterValue<int>("alias", defaultValue)`

#### Models Builder

a tool that generates strongly types models based upon Document Types. Since 7.4

Generates model to memory (on startup?)

see appSettings .Enable and .ModelsMode (PureLive ||  Dll || AppData || EnableApi || LiveDll || LiveAppData)

PureLive - runtime generation - for Um backoffice template use.

Dll - compiles to /bin/Umbraco.Web.PublishedContentModels.dll and restarts the application - for VS use. rm dll if switching to another mode.

AppData - models generated in /app_data/Models. Requires include in VS. Restarts the app. For VS use, extend, inherit etc. rm if switching.

API Models - use an API to expose models, requires VS extension (and Models builder api via Nuget). For CS use, extend, inherit and split out into a separate project. The API is only provided in debug mode. Also in appSettings .ModelsMode="", not ="EnableApi" , weirdly.





Models builder replaces Dynamic Published Content support (droped in v8). `CurrentPage.Property` etc. Probs because dynamics are a pain.
The IPublishedContent style was ` Model.Content.GetPropertyValue<T>` @CurrentPage and the UmbracoHelper query methods like @Umbraco.Content or @Umbraco.Media instead of the typed methods like @Umbraco.TypedContent and @Umbraco.TypedMedia show you are using dynamics

Models builder stylee `@Model.BodyText` is strongly typed.

If the .cshtml inherits from `UmbracoTemplatePage<T>` we can access DynamicPublishedContent and IPublishedContent.
In reality the actual class name for T will be underlined by VS, because in the native "PureLive" mode the model is generated at runtime, so currently does not exist.

```
var x = CurrentPage.ArticlePublishDate; // DPC returns a dynamic object = meh
var y = Model.Content.GetPropertyValue<DateTime>("articlePublishDate");
vay z = Model.Content.ArticlePublishDate; // new hotness via inherts of UmbracoTemplatePage<ContentModel.NewsItem>   
```

When we create a template (in the back office) Umbraco will add `@inherits Umbraco.Web.Mvc.UmbracoTemplatePage` which gives us
access to publsihed content models, we can traverse the tree etc.

When we create a DocumentType with an associated template, the template also has the `UmbracoTemplatePage<T>` and
`using ContentModels = Umbraco.Web.PublishedContentModels;'.

With UmbracoTemplatePage<T>, @Model.Content is an instance of T. Also exposes DynamicPublishedContent.


In v8 this is `UmbracoViewPage<T>` and @Model is an instance of T





















### Pipeline (from the v7 docs)
The inbound process is triggered by the Umbraco (http) Module. The published content request preparation process kicks in to create an PublishedContentRequest instance.

It is called in `UmbracoModule.ProcessRequest(â€¦)`

What it does:

+ It ensures Umbraco is ready, and the request is a document request.
+ Creates a PublishedContentRequest instance
+ Runs PublishedContentRequestEngine.PrepareRequest() for that instance
+ Handles redirects and status
+ Forwards missing content to 404
+ Forwards to either MVC or WebForms handlers

Once the request is prepared, an instance of PublishedContentRequest is available which represents the request that Umbraco must handle. It contains everything that will be needed to render it

Unless we are hihacking a route, everything then goes to `Umbraco.Web.Mvc.RenderMvcController` `Index()`
